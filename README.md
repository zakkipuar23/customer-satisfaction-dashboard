# Customer Satisfaction of Airline Company
For this challenge, I'm playing role of Senior Data Analyst for Maven Airlines, a US-based airline headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. The leadership team needs to take action fast, so they've brought me in to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting back on track.

## The task is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Maven Airlines' satisfaction rate, and present it in the form of a single page report or dashboard.
